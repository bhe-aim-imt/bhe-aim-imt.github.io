    \ custom-designed wearable three-lead Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, based\
    \ on EEG data collected from 73 depressed patients and 108 healthy controls. \n\
    Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits low-computational complexity\
    \ (65.0 K parameters), promising Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) performance\
    \ (25.6 M), real-time processing (1.5 s/execution), and low power consumption\
    \ (320.8 mW). \nFurthermore, it requires only 202.0 KB of Random Access Memory\
    \ (RAM) and 279.6 KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM) when deployed on the EEG sensor.\
    \ \nDespite its low computational and spatial complexity, the model achieves a\

  description: 'Heart sounds play a crucial role in assessing Coronary Artery Disease
    (CAD). The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has given
    rise to Computer Audition (CA)-based methods for CAD detection. However, previous
    research has focused primarily on analyzing and modeling heart sound data, overlooking
    practical application scenarios. In this work, we design a pervasive heart sound
    collection device used for high-quality heart sound data acquisition. Moreover,
    we introduce an on-board executable lightweight network tailored for the designed
    portable device, referred to as TYKDModel. Further, heart sound data from 41 CAD
    patients and 22 non-CAD healthy controls are collected using the developed device.
    Experimental results show that the TYKDModel exhibits low-computational complexity,
    with 52.16 K parameters and 5.03 M Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs). When deployed
    on the board, it requires only 1.10 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and 236.27
    KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and takes around 1.72 seconds to perform a classification.
    Despite the low computational and spatial complexity, the TYKDModel achieves a
    notable classification accuracy of 85.2%, specificity of 88.6%, and sensitivity
    of 82.8% on the board. These results indicate the promising potential of AI-assisted
    all-in-one integrated system for the diagnosis of heart sound-assisted CAD.

  description: 'Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally.
    Heart sound signal analysis plays an important role in clinical detection and
    physical examination of CVDs. In recent years, auxiliary diagnosis technology
    of CVDs based on the detection of heart sound signals has become a research hotspot.
    The detection of abnormal heart sounds can provide important clinical information
    to help doctors diagnose and treat heart disease. We propose a new set of fractal
    features-fractal dimension (FD)-as the representation for classification and a
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification model. The whole process of
    the method includes cutting heart sounds, feature extraction, and classification
    of abnormal heart sounds. We compare the classification results of the heart sound
    waveform (time domain) and the spectrum (frequency domain) based on fractal features.
    Finally, according to the better classification results, we choose the fractal
    features that are most conducive for classification to obtain better classification
    performance. The features we propose outperform the widely used features significantly
    (p < .05 by one-tailed z-test) with a much lower dimension. Clinical relevance-The
    heart sound classification model based on fractal provides a new time-frequency
    analysis method for heart sound signals. A new effective mechanism is proposed
    to explore the relationship between the heart sound acoustic properties and the
    pathology of CVDs. As a non-invasive diagnostic method, this work could supply
    an idea for the preliminary screening of cardiac abnormalities through heart sounds.

  description: 'Mental fatigue is a prevalent issue in contemporary society and can
    negatively affect physical performance and concentration, increasing the likelihood
    of adverse consequences due to inattention during productive activities. Therefore,
    it becomes increasingly important to address and eliminate fatigue within a specific
    period of time. Aromatherapy, as a form of Complementary Alternative Medicine
    (CAM), is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient method to combat fatigue.
    Previous studies have assessed the effects of specific aromatherapy oils using
    scales, but there is a lack of objective and reliable physiological indicators
    to prove the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Hence, this paper seeks to establish
    a model illustrating the effects of aromatic essential oil gases on the human
    body. A multimodal physiological fatigue signal acquisition system that integrates
    aromatherapy feedback was designed. In addition, an experimental paradigm was
    developed to explore the potential of aromatherapy in mitigating mental fatigue.
    Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were collected,
    allowing for the analysis of time-frequency domain features in EEG and ECG signals,
    as well as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features in ECG signals. Our findings
    indicate that specific aromatic gases demonstrate effectiveness in reducing mental
    fatigue. Furthermore, we employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to
    classify the state of human mental fatigue. Based on the classification results,
    the release of aromatic gas was controlled to provide targeted aromatic feedback.
    This innovative approach offers a promising avenue for objectively assessing and
    addressing mental fatigue through aromatherapy interventions.

  description: 'Mental disorders have increased rapidly and have emerged as a serious
    social health issue in the recent decade. Undoubtedly, the timely treatment of
    mental disorders is crucial. Emotion regulation has been proven to be an effective
    method for treating mental disorders. Music therapy as one of the methods that
    can achieve emotional regulation has gained increasing attention in the field
    of mental disorder treatment. However, traditional music therapy methods still
    face some unresolved issues, such as the lack of real-time capability and the
    inability to form closed-loop systems. With the advancement of artificial intelligence
    (AI), especially AI-generated content (AIGC), AI-based music therapy holds promise
    in addressing these issues. In this paper, an AIGC-based closed-loop music intervention
    system demonstration is proposed to regulate emotions for mental disorder treatment.
    This system demonstration consists of an emotion recognition model and a music
    generation model. The emotion recognition model can assess mental states, while
    the music generation model generates the corresponding emotional music for regulation.
    The system continuously performs recognition and regulation, thus forming a closed-loop
    process. In the experiment, we first conduct experiments on both the emotion recognition
    model and the music generation model to validate the accuracy of the recognition
    model and the music quality generated by the music generation models. In conclusion,
    we conducted comprehensive tests on the entire system to verify its feasibility
    and effectiveness.

  description: 'Emotion inhibitory control is a key executive function of the human
    brain, which regulates behavior by suppressing inappropriate responses. It plays
    an integral part in alleviating negative emotions, improving mood, and preventing
    depression. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been
    proved to enhance behavioral control, potentially suppressing negative emotions
    or facilitating their reduction in healthy individuals. However, the neurocomputational
    mechanisms underlying taVNS-induced neuroenhancement remain unclear. In this work,
    a portable electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and stimulation device is
    designed to collect eight-channel EEG signals and deliver taVNS to both sides
    of ears. Then, we design a protocol that successfully induced negative emotions
    in healthy subjects. Next, we conduct a sham-controlled experiment, involving
    28 healthy subjects, to explore the changes in EEG of negative emotions under
    taVNS. Finally, we primarily analyze the power spectrum density (PSD) of EEG signals
    and the functional connectivity network of the brain, based on the phase locking
    value (PLV), to assess the effect of taVNS on neural activity induced by negative
    emotions. The results of the experiment reveal that taVNS is a promising method
    for enhancing emotional inhibitory control by reducing PSD in the alpha band and
    enhancing PLV within prefrontal inhibitory control networks. In addition, differences
    in graph theory parameters between the Sham and taVNS conditions indicate that
    taVNS helps regulate negative emotions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates
    that taVNS enhances inhibitory control and reveals its neurocomputational mechanisms
    of EEG in healthy individuals during the development of negative emotions. And
    results indicate that taVNS could serve as a promising neuromodulation therapy
    for psychiatric disorders and individuals with depression or emotional distress.

  description: 'Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), as a method
    for mimicking VNS, has been proven effective in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.
    However, the underlying mechanism through which taVNS mimics VNS remains elusive.
    Moreover, the parameters of taVNS are singularly fixed and open loop in previous
    work, which is difficult to apply to all users as individual differences are inevitable.
    Since electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the important biomarkers of neural
    activity, this study aims to develop a closed-loop system for personalized interventions
    in emotion regulation by integrating taVNS with EEG feedback. We first design
    a taVNS system based on EEG signal feedback and verify the performance metrics
    of the system. Second, we design experimental paradigms to explore the changes
    in EEG features under the taVNS. The experimental results show that the EEG characteristics
    differ between different taVNS frequencies (between 50 and 100 Hz). Moreover,
    we observe substantial distinctions between EEG characteristics during the taVNS
    state and the resting state, with pre-taVNS, taVNS, and post-taVNS exhibiting
    notable differences. Specifically, the power spectral density (PSD) in the taVNS
    state is lower than in the resting state ( p<0.05 ), except for the beta band
    where the opposite trend is observed. Additionally, features such as Lempel-Ziv
    complexity (LZC) and Reyi entropy (REn) displayed a decreasing trend throughout
    the taVNS ( p<0.05 ). Furthermore, we employ hidden Markov models (HMMs) to reveal
    the heterogeneity of dynamic changes in the brain during taVNS, providing a mechanistic
    interpretation of taVNS.

  description: 'Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), a key emotion analysis technology,
    has shown significant value in various research areas. Previous SER models have
    achieved good emotion recognition accuracy, but typical centrally-based training
    requires centralised processing of speech data, which has a serious risk of privacy
    leakage. Federated learning (FL) can avoid centralised data processing through
    distributed learning, providing a solution for privacy protection in SER. However,
    FL faces several challenges in practical applications, including imbalanced data
    distribution and inconsistent labelling. Furthermore, typical FL frameworks focus
    on client-side enhancement and ignore server-side aggregation strategy optimisation,
    which can increase the computational load on the client side. To address the aforementioned
    problems, we propose a novel approach, FedVCPL-Diff. Firstly, regarding information
    fusion, we introduce a diffusion model on the server side to generate Valence-Arousal-Dominance
    emotion space features, which replaces the typical aggregation framework and effectively
    promotes global information fusion. In addition, in terms of information exchange,
    we propose a lightweight and personalised FL transmission framework based on the
    exchange of VAD features. FedVCPL-Diff optimises the local model by updating the
    data distribution anchors, which not only avoids the privacy risk but also reduces
    the communication cost. Experimental results show that the framework significantly
    improves emotion recognition performance compared to four commonly used FL frameworks.
    The overall performance of our framework also shows a significant advantage compared
    to locally independent models.

  description: 'In noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), EEG analysis plays
    a critical role, with neural networks serving as a cornerstone for signal decoding.
    Existing neural network approaches for EEG signal recognition require extensive
    manual design and hyperparameter tuning, leading to inefficiencies and making
    them impractical for embedded devices due to their large model size. To address
    these limitations, we propose mixed-level differentiable and hardware-aware neural
    architecture search (MDH-NAS), a framework that automatically generates lightweight
    neural networks tailored for EEG classification. Unlike traditional DARTS methods,
    MDH-NAS employs a hybrid optimization strategy that balances global and local
    search spaces, thereby accelerating and refining architecture discovery. It introduces
    explicit size constraints during the search process to ensure deployability on
    embedded devices. MDH-NAS demonstrates autonomous generation of architectures
    for tasks such as motor imagery (MI) and depression recognition, achieving 87.80%
    accuracy on the BCI-IV dataset and 90.09% on the MODMA dataset. When deployed
    on the EAIDK-610 board across heterogeneous tasks, it attains 85.37% accuracy
    on the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery dataset. This method reduces architecture discovery
    time by 89% and enhances prediction accuracy by 8.70% compared to baseline methods,
    highlighting its potential for scalable EEG analysis and real-world embedded deployment.
