  description: "The development of affective computing and medical electronic technologies\
    \ has led to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods for the\
    \ early detection of depression. \nHowever, previous studies have often overlooked\
    \ the necessity for the AI-assisted diagnosis system to be wearable and accessible\
    \ in practical scenarios for depression recognition. \nIn this work, we present\
    \ an on-board executable multi-feature transfer-enhanced fusion model for our\
    \ custom-designed wearable three-lead Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, based\
    \ on EEG data collected from 73 depressed patients and 108 healthy controls. \n\
    Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits low-computational complexity\
    \ (65.0 K parameters), promising Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) performance\
    \ (25.6 M), real-time processing (1.5 s/execution), and low power consumption\
    \ (320.8 mW). \nFurthermore, it requires only 202.0 KB of Random Access Memory\
    \ (RAM) and 279.6 KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM) when deployed on the EEG sensor.\
    \ \nDespite its low computational and spatial complexity, the model achieves a\
    \ notable classification accuracy of 95.2%, specificity of 94.0%, and sensitivity\
    \ of 96.9% under independent test conditions. \nThese results underscore the potential\
    \ of deploying the model on the wearable three-lead EEG sensor for assisting in\

  description: 'Heart sounds play a crucial role in assessing Coronary Artery Disease
    (CAD). The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has given
    rise to Computer Audition (CA)-based methods for CAD detection. However, previous
    research has focused primarily on analyzing and modeling heart sound data, overlooking
    practical application scenarios. In this work, we design a pervasive heart sound
    collection device used for high-quality heart sound data acquisition. Moreover,
    we introduce an on-board executable lightweight network tailored for the designed
    portable device, referred to as TYKDModel. Further, heart sound data from 41 CAD
    patients and 22 non-CAD healthy controls are collected using the developed device.
    Experimental results show that the TYKDModel exhibits low-computational complexity,
    with 52.16 K parameters and 5.03 M Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs). When deployed
    on the board, it requires only 1.10 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and 236.27
    KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and takes around 1.72 seconds to perform a classification.
    Despite the low computational and spatial complexity, the TYKDModel achieves a
    notable classification accuracy of 85.2%, specificity of 88.6%, and sensitivity
    of 82.8% on the board. These results indicate the promising potential of AI-assisted
    all-in-one integrated system for the diagnosis of heart sound-assisted CAD.

  description: 'Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally.
    Heart sound signal analysis plays an important role in clinical detection and
    physical examination of CVDs. In recent years, auxiliary diagnosis technology
    of CVDs based on the detection of heart sound signals has become a research hotspot.
    The detection of abnormal heart sounds can provide important clinical information
    to help doctors diagnose and treat heart disease. We propose a new set of fractal
    features-fractal dimension (FD)-as the representation for classification and a
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification model. The whole process of
    the method includes cutting heart sounds, feature extraction, and classification
    of abnormal heart sounds. We compare the classification results of the heart sound
    waveform (time domain) and the spectrum (frequency domain) based on fractal features.
    Finally, according to the better classification results, we choose the fractal
    features that are most conducive for classification to obtain better classification
    performance. The features we propose outperform the widely used features significantly
    (p < .05 by one-tailed z-test) with a much lower dimension. Clinical relevance-The
    heart sound classification model based on fractal provides a new time-frequency
    analysis method for heart sound signals. A new effective mechanism is proposed
    to explore the relationship between the heart sound acoustic properties and the
    pathology of CVDs. As a non-invasive diagnostic method, this work could supply
    an idea for the preliminary screening of cardiac abnormalities through heart sounds.

  description: 'Functional connectivity (FC) network derived from resting-state functional
    magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been extensively employed in the automated
    identification of brain disorders. Conventional FC network modeling methods typically
    assign equal importance to different sampling points of rs-fMRI and brain regions
    of interest (ROIs). Nevertheless, considering temporal and regional heterogeneity,
    this assumption may not always be applicable. Moreover, sparse regression algorithms
    with regularization terms are commonly adopted to eliminate spurious FC. However,
    these conventional regularization terms impose a uniform sparse penalty on all
    FC without considering the prior knowledge that the brain tends to transmit information
    in an energetically efficient manner. To address the above problems, we propose
    an adaptive weight and Wasserstein distance constrained low-rank sparse representation
    (AW-WD-LSR) method to construct FC networks. Specifically, we employ adaptive
    weights to the reconstruction errors of rs-fMRI time series across various ROIs
    and sampling points, thereby amplifying the significance of crucial features in
    the joint representation, leading to a more robust FC network. Meanwhile, we incorporate
    a local constraint by introducing the optimal transport distance (i.e., Wasserstein
    distance) between ROIs to adjust the sparse penalty on the corresponding FC. The
    larger Wasserstein distance, the higher information transmission cost between
    two ROIs, resulting in a greater penalty imposed on the corresponding FC. The
    efficacy of the innovation modules is demonstrated in classification tasks involving
    major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features (MMF), MDD without mixed features
    (MDDnoMF), and healthy controls (HCs).

  description: 'Mental fatigue is a prevalent issue in contemporary society and can
    negatively affect physical performance and concentration, increasing the likelihood
    of adverse consequences due to inattention during productive activities. Therefore,
    it becomes increasingly important to address and eliminate fatigue within a specific
    period of time. Aromatherapy, as a form of Complementary Alternative Medicine
    (CAM), is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient method to combat fatigue.
    Previous studies have assessed the effects of specific aromatherapy oils using
    scales, but there is a lack of objective and reliable physiological indicators
    to prove the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Hence, this paper seeks to establish
    a model illustrating the effects of aromatic essential oil gases on the human
    body. A multimodal physiological fatigue signal acquisition system that integrates
    aromatherapy feedback was designed. In addition, an experimental paradigm was
    developed to explore the potential of aromatherapy in mitigating mental fatigue.
    Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were collected,
    allowing for the analysis of time-frequency domain features in EEG and ECG signals,
    as well as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features in ECG signals. Our findings
    indicate that specific aromatic gases demonstrate effectiveness in reducing mental
    fatigue. Furthermore, we employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to
    classify the state of human mental fatigue. Based on the classification results,
    the release of aromatic gas was controlled to provide targeted aromatic feedback.
    This innovative approach offers a promising avenue for objectively assessing and
    addressing mental fatigue through aromatherapy interventions.
